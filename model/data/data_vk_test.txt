[Prompt][Prompt]Given an input feature vector X maybe corresponding to an image that you want to recognize as either a cat picture or not a cat picture, you want an algorithm that can output a prediction, which we'll call Y hat, which is your estimate of Y.[Prompt][Prompt][Prompt][Prompt]input feature vector[Prompt]X/identification

[Prompt][Prompt]Well, one thing you could try, that doesn't work, would be to have Y hat be W transpose X plus B, kind of a linear function of the input X.[Prompt][Prompt][Prompt][Prompt]W transpose X plus B[Prompt]W/used

[Prompt][Prompt]So Y hat should really be between zero and one, and it's difficult to enforce that because W transpose X plus B can be much bigger than one or it can even be negative, which doesn't make sense for probability, that you want it to be between zero and one.[Prompt][Prompt][Prompt][Prompt]Y hat[Prompt]much bigger than one/attribute

[Prompt][Prompt] You might have real switches, you might have switches where you just flip something up and down, turn things on and off, but oftentimes, it's useful to have an electrical switch because you want to have something that may be turns on and off that is itself controlled by another party or circuit[Prompt][Prompt][Prompt][Prompt]electrical switch[Prompt]controlled by another party or circuit/attribute
